# TrafficDetectionSystem

Traffic detection system is the online platform which helps to detect the traffic of the desired route and follow the appropriate route. 
The system alerts the user if there's any heavy traffic in their desired route. 

Not only traffic detection, this system also helps to follow the optimum route, as some route seem to be short but might take longer time to reach.

Traffic detection sensors are placed on the roads to calculate the traffic of the route. 
Using the sensors, the traffic is calculated in real time and users are notified about it.
